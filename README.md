ðŸš€ BlazorApp

This project was generated using the .NET CLI

ðŸ“– Overview

BlazorApp is a web application built with ASP.NET Core Blazor, a framework for building interactive client-side web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
Blazor allows you to create rich web interfaces with reusable components and full access to .NET libraries and tooling.

Depending on the chosen template (blazorserver or blazorwasm), the app runs either:

Blazor Server: The UI runs on the server over a real-time SignalR connection.

Blazor WebAssembly: The UI runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly.

ðŸ§© Features
Component-based architecture (Razor components)
Built with C# and .NET
Supports data binding, routing, and dependency injection
Easy integration with APIs and existing .NET code
Modern UI using Razor syntax and Bootstrap (by default)
